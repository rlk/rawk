# RAWK

RAWK is a command-line tool capable of performing a variety of image processing operations on very large raw binary image files. It provides a pannable, zoomable preview of the result of the process and enables image process parameters to be tuned interactively regardless of the scale of the input and output.

- [The Manual and Documentation are available on GitHub Pages](https://rlk.github.io/rawk).

The repo has a submodule ([GLFundamentals](https://github.com/rlk/GLFundamentals)). It must be explicitly added to a fresh clone...

	git submodule update --init

Todo:
- better error messages
- BMP example
